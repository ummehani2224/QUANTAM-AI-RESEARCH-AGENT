Synthesize these inputs.
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You must NOT provide direct investment advice.
- You must NOT recommend BUY, HOLD, or SELL. Only explain market intelligence.
- Determine the overall Market Bias as Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral.
- The risk level should be consistent with the calculated risk: {calculated_risk}.
- The confidence should be consistent with the calculated weighted confidence: {calculated_confidence}%.
